# WhatsApp_clone
This project is basically cloning a whatsApp screen including all the icons and the necessary designs in it.
This project is executed in android studio using flutter and have used dart language for the app.
This project is made to understand the basic features and functions in a dart program.
As I didn't have emulator in my studio, so I used web emulator
Here is the snapshot of the whatsapp clone!
